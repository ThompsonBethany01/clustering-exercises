# Clustering Exercises 
> Completed by Bethany Thompson in the Darden Codeup Cohort  
## Clustering is...
- Unsupervised machine learning methodology
- Used to group and identify similar observations when we do not have labels that identify the groups.
- Often a preprocessing or an exploratory step in the data science pipeline.  

## Learning Goals
1. Be able to discuss and discover use cases for clustering across multiple industries.
2. Be able to recognize of common clustering algorithms.
3. General understanding of how the k-means clustering algorithm works.
4. Ability to implement k-means clustering in python.
5. Ability to make use of clusters discovered later down the data science pipeline.
